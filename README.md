# Ammy.Dog

Speedrunning tools/stats for Okami speedrunning.

Not actually at ammy.dog anymore. Can't afford the domain. It's just at the standard GH Pages site now: https://zysim.github.io/Ammy.Dog.

## What It Has

Currently, it just gives you the times where you'd have to submit video proof for, if you do a run. From the Game Rules on our [SRC page](https://www.speedrun.com/okami):

> Video proof is mandatory for all submissions faster than 110% the length of the current World Record in each category.
