  <p>Hey there üê∫</p>
  <p>
    This is a site to check what the in-game time (IGT) threshold is for an
    Okami speedrun submission to require video proof, as determined by the Okami
    speedrunning community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Naturally I need JS to run this page, to retrieve the current world record
    times for every speedrunning category (and calculate the threshold time
    (it's WR * 1.1 btw)). If you're still not comfortable with allowing JS here,
    you'll have to head to the
    <a href="speedrun.com/okami">speedrun.com page</a>, check the WR times, and
    do the calculations yourself (which of course requires JS as well there).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're interested in speedrunning the game tho be sure to check out
    <a href="https://okami.speedruns.wiki/Main_Page">our Wiki</a> and
    <a href="https://discord.gg/AQNKmMu">our Discord!</a> (All links are on the
    SRC page too.)
